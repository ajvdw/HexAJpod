Hexapod ESP8266

This repository contains

- OpenScad cad design file for a 3d printed hexapod
- stl files for printing
- hexapod firmware for the ESP8266 Arduino IDE

Have a look at: https://youtu.be/j8itndjbUWE

The hexapod will act as an Wifi Access point.
You can connect to it using the password (bestkeptsecret).
Open a web page and visit http://192.168.4.1 
This opens a page with the remote control.
When fully loaded, a websocket connection is opened.

You should be able to build it for less than 100$
